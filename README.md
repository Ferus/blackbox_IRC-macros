## About

This python module - simply called blackbox from here on - is intended to 
encapsulate most of the low level IRC protocol into handy, easily callable 
methods of an IRC object that contains the socket object.
It is mainly meant to be used in bots, but can of course be used for any 
other application communicating with an IRC server as well.

## Implementation Status & Roadmap

The current state of the RFC implementation of the develop branch can be found 
[on the wiki of this project]
(https://github.com/proxypoke/blackbox_IRC-macros/wiki/Status-of-RFC-Implementation).

There is also a roadmap, which can be found [on the wiki as well]
(https://github.com/proxypoke/blackbox_IRC-macros/wiki/Roadmap).

## Branching

I'm trying out the branching model described [here]
(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Although overkill 
for such a small, one-man project, I'd like to get used to this style of 
version control.
